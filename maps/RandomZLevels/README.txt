3. Move the SS21 map file into -tg-station-master/maps/RandomZlevels
4. Open the fileList notepad file in that location, delete all other maps/RandomZLevels/randommapcrap.dmm except for one.
5. Rename the line to maps/RandomZlevels/SS21.dmm, remove the # at the start if you haven't already (this prevented them from being loaded)
